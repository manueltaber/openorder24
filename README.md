This is the Angular2 port of the "OpenOrder24" - App. Try out our hosted DEMO version of the Ionic-App (Master-Branch): [DEMO](https://project-5410628368334979052.firebaseapp.com/).

## Getting started with the Ionic-App

First of all you have to install the ionic cli:
````
> npm install -g ionic@beta

Open /ionicapp afterwards and execute these commands:

Everything should work fine now (probably)
